I am very pleased to announce the release of **goa v1.1.0**! This release
includes all the work done in the `v1` branch since the release of `v1.0.0`
roughly four months ago. This includes 30 bug fixes, 18 new features and many
minor improvements made by 24 contributors. This being a `v1.x.x` release means
that all existing users currently using `v1.0.0` can upgrade seamlessly with no
modification to the existing code.

## Why Release v1.1.0 Now?

Many goa users prefer to stick to the official release tags rather than to
follow the `v1` branch. There are a number of bug fixes that would benefit these
users in `v1.1.0` and as we get close to the end of the year the choice was
between releasing now or waiting until next year, so now it is!

Releasing every 4 months seems like a good release cadence as well, look for
another release in April 2017.

## What's New?

The complete list of commits is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0). Here are the
most noteworthy additions in this new release.

### Programmatic Code Generation

This contribution from [Alexandre Bourget](https://github.com/abourget) makes it
convenient to invoke the generators programmatically rather than through
`goagen`.
See [Code-based generation and vendoring](https://goa.design/design/vendoring/)
for additional details.

***Pull Request:***

* [Make a nice API to programmatically generate your code, and facilitate vendoring.](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/686)

---

### Swagger Support Improvements

Many bug fixes and improvements were made to the Swagger support. Most
notably [Taichi Sasaki](https://github.com/tchssk) added support for
[Swagger extensions](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/guidelines/EXTENSIONS.md)
through the use of [Metadata](https://goa.design/reference/goa/design/apidsl/#func-metadata-a-name-apidsl-metadata-a).

Swagger generation can now also be disabled for specific endpoints using the new
`swagger:generate`
[Metadata](https://goa.design/reference/goa/design/apidsl/#func-metadata-a-name-apidsl-metadata-a).

The main fixes include properly setting the collection format on parameters of
type `Array` (fix from [@fede-bitlogic](https://github.com/fede-bitlogic)) and
proper generation of the `Any` type (issue initially reported
by [Peter Dulačka](https://github.com/rootpd)).

***Pull Requests:***

* [Support swagger extensions](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/779)
* [Add ability to set JSON encoded Swagger extension values](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/788)
* [Try to use swagger extensions as JSON by default](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/790)
* [Implement "swagger:generate" metadata](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/863)
* [swagger ui fails to send a proper request when a paramter is Arrayof(...)](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/858)
* [Generate empty schema for Any type](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/936)

---

### Query String Array Parameters

Proper support for arrays in query strings was added (initially reported by
[Thorsten von Eicken](https://github.com/tve)).

***Pull Request:***

* [Properly handle array params](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/684)

---

### Security Improvements

 [Jared Bischof](https://github.com/jaredbischof) added the ability to
dynamically change the set of JWT keys used to authorize incoming requests.

[Evgeny Gavrilov](https://github.com/EvgenyGavrilov) also cleaned up the Swagger
specification generated for the JWT security scheme.

***Pull Requests:***

* [Added the ability to dynamically add/remove keys from the jwt security middleware after creation.](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/818)
* [Refactor JWT key resolver](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/832)
* [Do not add a list of security scopes in the description swagger, if it is empty](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/823)

---

### CORS Support Improvements

CORS origins can now be matched using regular expressions thanks to a PR from
[Matteo Suppo](https://github.com/matteosuppo). Matteo also fixed the value of
the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header returned by goa when an origin
matches the specification.

CORS support was also added for file servers (issue initially reported by
[Peter Dulačka](https://github.com/rootpd)).

***Pull Requests:***

* [Allow cors spec to be defined as regexps](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/723)
* [Generate cors headers without wildcards](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/717)
* [Generate CORS preflight handler for file server endpoints](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/763)

---

### Support for Modifying the goa Error Response Content-Type

This PR addresses a common request which is the ability to override the error
media type identifier used by goa when validation errors occur. With this change
it is now possible to override the identifier returned in the Content-Type header
of error responses.

***Pull Request:***

* [Make ErrorMediaIdentifier a variable instead of a constant](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/697)

---

### Support for UUID parameters on the CLI

[Aslak Knutsen](https://github.com/aslakknutsen) added proper support for UUID
parameters in the code generation algorithms used to generate the client CLI.

***Pull Request:***

* [Generate direct access to cmd.FieldName when resolving path params](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/701)

---

### Logging

The log messages now include the name of the controller and action thanks to a PR
from [Konstantin Dzreev](https://github.com/konstantin-dzreev).
[Craig Brookes](https://github.com/maleck13) also made it possible to log the
complete backtrace of errors are returned by controllers that are wrapped using
[Dave Cheney](https://github.com/davecheney)'s
[errors package](https://github.com/pkg/errors) `Wrap` function.

***Pull Requests:***

* [Add "ctrl" and "action" key/values to the "completed" log message](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/774)
* [Add ability to log backtraces to ErrorHandler middleware](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/792)

---

### DSL

The DSL
[UseTrait](https://goa.design/reference/goa/design/apidsl/#func-usetrait-a-name-apidsl-usetrait-a)
function was improved by [Jeroen Simonetti](https://github.com/jsimonetti) to
allow invoking more than one trait in a single call.

***Pull Request:***

* [Change UseTrait APIDSL function to be variadic](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/816)

---

### Miscellaneous

[Yusuke Hatanaka](https://github.com/hatajoe) added the
[Serve](https://goa.design/reference/goa/#func-service-serve-a-name-goa-service-serve-a)
method to the `Service` struct making it convenient for goa services to listen
on Unix sockets for example.

[Jeroen Simonetti](https://github.com/jsimonetti) made it possible to pass
arguments to custom generator on the command line by appending them after a
final `--` separator.

Finally [Taichi Sasaki](tchssk) contributed a change to the generated code
headers that tells github to ignore the generated files in PR diffs (very
cool!).


***Pull Requests:***

* [Add unix domain socket listener to service.ListenAndServeUnix](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/837)
* [Pass arguments to final generator](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/947)
* [Suppress diffs of generated codes on GitHub](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/953)

## What's Fixed?

This release includes many bug fixes as well, including:

---

### Payload Type Generation

A fix done shortly after the release of `v1.0.0` was the removal of the
generation of duplicated structs for payload types. The DSL makes it possible
to refer to a user type in the
[Payload](https://goa.design/reference/goa/design/apidsl/#func-payload-a-name-apidsl-payload-a)
function and optionally to further customize it for example by specifying
required attributes. Only in this case will two types be generated after this fix.

[@ikawaha](https://github.com/ikawaha) fixed the code generation so that
DateTime default values are now properly set (this applies to media type as well).

[@KerwinKoo](https://github.com/KerwinKoo) fixed the marshaling of UUID values in JSON.

* [Fix potential duplicate generation of payload types](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/681)
* [Fix setting a default value to datetime](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/758)
* [Add (Un)Marshal Text/Binary methods to support json parsing](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/678)

---

### Media Type Generation

The value specified in the
[ContentType](https://goa.design/reference/goa/design/apidsl/#func-contenttype-a-name-apidsl-contenttype-a)
DSL function is now properly honored in the generated code thanks to a fix
by [George Dobrovolsky](https://github.com/dobegor)). George also reported an
issue with how examples for links were generated.

***Pull Request:***

* [Fix ContentType isn't applied in MediaType](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/704)
* [Fix generation of examples for media types](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/702)

---

### Examples Generation

Generated examples for media type now properly take into account the view (issue
initially reported by [George Dobrovolsky](https://github.com/dobegor)).

***Pull Request:***

* [Fix generation of examples for media types](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/702)

---

### Validations Generation

[@ikawaha](https://github.com/ikawaha) fixed the generation of length validation
for strings that contain multi-byte UTF-8 characters.

Another fix corrects the code generated for float64 minimum and maximum values
(issue initially reported by [Luna Duclos](https://github.com/PSG-Luna)).

The validation code generated for arrays of user types now properly checks for
nil elements (issue initially reported
by [Robert Lee](https://github.com/leerobertw)).

***Pull Requests:***

* [Fix length validations to count the length of the string using by utf8.RuneCountInString()](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/740)
* [Properly handle float range errors](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/744)
* [Protect array validation against nil elements](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/957)

---

### Test generation

There were many fixes done to the generated test helpers. One notable addition
is a PR from [Kannan Manickam](https://github.com/arangamani) which changes the
generated code to use an interface instead of `testing.T` directly. This makes
it convenient to pass other structs that implement the interface for example
provided by different test packages.

[Craig Brookes](https://github.com/maleck13) also added proper header comments
to the generated code.

Finally [Ian Delahorne](https://github.com/lflux) added a missing import
statement for the `guid` package.

***Pull Requests:***

* [Fix test helper panic when controller does not write media type](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/719)
* [Fail test fatally if media type is not of the right type](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/721)
* [Add an interface instead of using testing.T](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/733)
* [address issue 738 by creating a title for the test file](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/780)
* [Add uuid to test helper imports. Fixes #870](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/873)

---

### Logging

[Jim Slattery](https://github.com/jim-slattery-rs) cleaned up the code used to
append the values in the log context when using the standard logger to avoid
possible concurrent modifications.

***Pull Request:***

* [removed unneeded check which would make an unsafe concurrent modification](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/736)

---

### Swagger generation

[Taichi Sasaki](https://github.com/tchssk) fixed the handling of Metadata tags
in the generated Swagger specification. He also made sure data structure tags
are generated in alphabetical order.

[@ikawaha](https://github.com/ikawaha) also fixed a bug where the Required field
for payload would always be set to true even for optional payloads.

***Pull Requests:***

* [Fix to contain only valid tags in gen_swagger](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/782)
* [Fix a bug that the payload is always required 'true' in swagger documents.](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/825)

---

### Metrics collection

[Xander Guzman](https://github.com/theshadow) made sure that metrics tags are properly
escaped before being reported to the metrics server.

***Pull Request:***

* [Modify metrics so that names are normalized to legal chars](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/771)

---

### Client

The API key signer now properly signs requests and the key is properly escaped
when specified on the command line in the generated CLI tool.

The code generated for clients that use required `UUID` values in headers now
compiles properly (issue initially reported
by [Naoya Yoshizawa](https://github.com/azihsoyn)).

The client methods now only include a `ContentType` argument is the API supports
multiple decodings. Many thanks to [Konrad Kleine](https://github.com/kwk) for
fixing the mess I created with the first commit...

***Pull Requests:***

* [Fix API key signer](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/784)
* [Properly format query string API keys from command line arguments](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/786)
* [Fix code that sets request headers in client package](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/960)
* [Fixup for 2e83b0dfdd45e1e54615606924dca565b547b08b](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/900)

---

### goagen

[Sye van der Veen](https://github.com/Syeberman) reported and fixed issues with
the handling of the `--notool` flag.

## Conclusion

This list only covers the main contributions, it is clear that a lot of work
went into this release. A big thank you to all the contributors! As the work
on [v2](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/projects/1) proceeds, expect at least
one more v1 release with additional bug fixes and new features. In the mean time
though enjoy `v1.1.0`!
