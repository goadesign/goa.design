The Goa community has contributed many fixes to Goa as adoption of v3 grows.
This release builds on v3.0.1 and v3.0.2 and adds several more fixes. In
particular:

* [Nitin Mohan](https://github.com/Nitin) fixed a couple of issues with the
  generated OpenAPI specifications
  ([#2141](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2141))
  ([#2159](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2159)).
* [@ikawaha](https://github.com/ikawaha) fixed a few issues with the generation
  of Go identifiers
  ([#2144](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2144))
  ([#2152](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2152))
  ([#2172](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2172)). @ikawaha also made it
  possible to use specific shas to point to Goa v3 in `go.mod` and made sure
  the code generation algorithms honored it
  ([#2182](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2182)).
* [Ruggero](https://github.com/ilmaruk) added support for plain text to the
  default Goa encoder and decoder
  ([#2165](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2165)).
* [Kaosisochukwu Uzokwe](https://github.com/delkopiso) fixed a potential panic
  in the gRPC client method builder
  ([#2186](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2186)).
* [Tim Adam](https://github.com/tmaflexera) moved the XRay test helpers into
  a separate package to avoid side effects when loading the `testing` package
  ([#2190](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2190)).
* [Carl Quinn](https://github.com/cquinn) fixed an issue with the code
  generation of CLI arguments of type `[]byte`
  ([#2196](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2196)).
* [Raphael Simon](https://github.com/raphael) fixed a couple of issues with the
  handling of array attributes in responses
  ([#2200](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2200))
  ([#2202](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2202)).

v3.0.1 and v3.0.2 added a few other fixes. A notable addition contributed by
[@CuBiC](https://github.com/CuBiC) in v3.0.1 is the ability to set scopes on
basic auth and API key security schemes. The scopes can be defined in the design
and are made available to the security enforcing functions at runtime
([#2120](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/2120)).
