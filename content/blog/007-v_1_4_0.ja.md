It's been almost a year since the last official release of goa. During that year
many contributions have been made including both new features and bug fixes. The
team has also been hard at work on v2 making good progress there but this post
is about the latest v1 release: `goa v1.4.0`.

## New Features

### Multipart Form Encoding

Taichi Sasaki (@tchssk) added native support for multipart form encoding as
described in the
[HTML 4 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.2).
The new `MultipartForm` function can be used in an action design as follows:

```go
var _ = Resource("profiles", func() {
	Action("submit", func() {
		Routing(POST("profiles"))
		Payload(ProfilePayload)
		MultipartForm() // Uses "multipart/form-data" encoding
		Description("Post accepts a multipart form encoded request")
		Response(OK, ResultMedia)
	})
})
```

The
[Multipart Form Encoding example](https://github.com/goadesign/examples/tree/master/multipart_form)
provides a complete design and example implementation.

### Primitive File Type

Taichi Sasaki (@tchssk) also added the ability to map payload attributes to
multipart files making it convenient to implement file upload in goa. The new
`File` type can be used in combination with `MultipartForm()` as follows:

```go
var _ = Resource("profiles", func() {
	Action("submit", func() {
		Routing(POST("profiles"))
		Payload(ProfilePayload)
		MultipartForm() // Uses "multipart/form-data" encoding
		Description("Post accepts a multipart form encoded request")
		Response(OK, ResultMedia)
	})
})

var ProfilePayload = Type("ProfilePayload", func() {
	Attribute("name", String, "Name")
	Attribute("birthday", DateTime, "Birthday")
	Attribute("icon", File, "Icon") // Attribute "icon" contains a file
	Required("name", "birthday", "icon")
})
```

The controller can then simply access the file content as follows:

```go
	file, err := ctx.Payload.Icon.Open()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer file.Close()
	f, err := os.OpenFile("./icons/"+ctx.Payload.Icon.Filename, os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE, 0666)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to save file: %s", err) // causes a 500 response
	}
	defer f.Close()
	io.Copy(f, file)
```

The
[Multipart Form Encoding example](https://github.com/goadesign/examples/tree/master/multipart_form)
provides a complete design and example implementation.

### Sensitive Headers Suppression

Adam Hanna (@adam-hanna) made it possible to identify header values that should
not be logged by the `LogRequest` middleware. The names of the corresponding
headers should be given to the new variadic middleware constructor parameter:

```go
middleware.LogRequest(true, "Authorization", "Api-Key", "Owner-Email")
```

[Add ability to suppress sensitive headers from log #1691](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1691) - Adam Hanna

### OpenAPI Specification Read-Only Fields

Daniel I. Khan Ramiro (@dikhan) added the ability to specify read-only
attributes. Such attributes are marked as read-only in the generated OpenAPI
specification and behave like other attributes otherwise.

```go
var TypeWithReadOnlyAttributes = Type("Foo", func() {
	Attribute("standard", String)
	Attribute("read-only", String, func() {
		ReadOnly()
	})
})
```

[Add support for readonly attributes #1776](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1776) - Daniel I. Khan Ramiro

### Support for RFC3339 Date Format

Konstantin Lepa (@k-lepa) added support for date only format. goa had support
for the RFC3339 DateTime format this PR adds support for the RFC3339 Date
format, eg: `2017-11-16`.

```go
var TypeWithDate = Type("Foo", func() {
	Attribute("date", String, func() {
		Format("date")
	})
})
```

[Add RFC3339 date format #1787](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1787) - Konstantin Lepa

# Support JWT Authorization via Query String

Jie Kang (@jiekang) made it possible for clients to provide the JWT token used
for authorization in the HTTP request query string parameters (on top of HTTP
headers).

## Thank You!

A big thank you to all the contributors! A special thank you to Jie Kang who
helped put together these release notes.

As we look ahead for goa the big ticket item is the release of v2. v2 is being
used in production in a few sites already, the last pieces needed before it can
be released (i.e. made the default version) are the gRPC transport and better
documentation. Head over to the repo and check out the
[README](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/blob/v2/README.md) for more
information.
