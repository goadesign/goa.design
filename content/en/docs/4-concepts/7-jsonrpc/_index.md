This section provides focused guidance for building JSON‑RPC 2.0 services with
Goa. It complements the high‑level transport matrix by detailing the JSON‑RPC
DSL, transport semantics, streaming patterns, batching, notifications, and error
mapping.

If you are new to transport combinations, start with the [Transports](../6-transports)
page, then return here for JSON‑RPC specifics.
