  Deep dive into Goa-AI's core concepts: DSL, runtime, toolsets, and MCP integration.
---

This section covers the core concepts you need to understand to effectively use Goa-AI:

1. [DSL Reference](./1-dsl/) - Learn all available DSL functions for defining agents, toolsets, and policies
2. [Runtime](./2-runtime/) - Understand how the runtime orchestrates agents, enforces policies, and manages state
3. [Toolsets](./3-toolsets/) - Learn about toolset types, execution models, and composition patterns
4. [MCP Integration](./4-mcp-integration.md) - Integrate external MCP servers into your agents
5. [Transcripts](./5-transcripts.md) - Learn how transcripts and message parts simplify planner, UI, and provider state
6. [Tool Validation & Retry Hints](./6-tool-validation-retry-hints.md) - See how Goa-AI turns validation failures into structured retries the planner can repair
7. [Tool Catalogs & Schemas](./7-tool-catalogs-schemas.md) - Discover tools and JSON Schemas exported by agents
8. [Run Trees & Streaming](./8-run-trees-streaming-topology.md) - Understand per-run streams, AgentRunStarted links, and stream profiles
9. [Policies & Labels](./9-policies-labels.md) - Configure caps, time budgets, and labels via RunPolicy and runtime overrides
10. [LLM Integration](./10-llm-integration.md) - Integrate LLM providers like AWS Bedrock and OpenAI through the provider-agnostic model client interface
11. [System Reminders](./11-system-reminders.md) - Deliver structured, rate-limited backstage guidance to models
