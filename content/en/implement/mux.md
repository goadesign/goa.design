# Service Mux

The goa HTTP request mux is in charge of dispatching incoming requests to the correct controller
action. It implements the goa
[ServeMux](http://goa.design/reference/goa/#type-servemux-a-name-goa-servemux-a) interface which on
top of the usual binding of HTTP method and path to handler also provides the ability to lookup
registered handlers.

The `ServeMux` interface
[Handle](http://goa.design/reference/goa/#type-servemux-a-name-goa-servemux-a) method associates a
request HTTP method and path to a
[MuxHandler](http://goa.design/reference/goa/#type-muxhandler-a-name-goa-muxhandler-a) which is a
function that accepts an http ResponseWriter and Request as well as an instance of url Values that
contain all the path and querystring parameters.

The code generated by `goagen` automatically calls the `Handle` function.  Calling this function
directly is only needed to mount handlers that are not generated, for example handlers that may
provide supporting functionality that comes from third party packages. In particular wrapping a HTTP
handler from the stdlib [http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler) package is trivially done:

```go
// assetHandler returns the handler in charge of serving static assets.
func assetHandler() goa.MuxHandler {
    base := "/path/to/website/static/files"
    h := gzip.FileServer(http.Dir(base))
    return func(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, v url.Values) {
        h.ServeHTTP(rw, req)
    }
}
```

Such handlers can be mounted on the service mux:

```
func main() {
    service := goa.New("Service with assets")
    service.Mux.Handle("GET", "/static/*asset", assetHandler())
    // ...
}
```

## Handling NotFound

The `ServeMux` interface also exposes a `HandleNotFound` method which sets the handler invoked when
a request is sent to a path that does not correspond to a registered handler. The `Service` data 
structure takes advantage of that function to register a generic not found handler which returns a
response with status code 404.
